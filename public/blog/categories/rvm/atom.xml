    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>%p
  Ugg.  For the past four or five days, I&rsquo;ve been struggling to get all my gems
  installed for a Ruby 1.9.3 project I&rsquo;ve been helping on (which is annoying
  because everything was working fine the last time I worked on it.)  I use RVM
  to manage my ruby versions, and for the longest time I&rsquo;ve let it manage its
  dependencies by itself.  RVM seems to prefer using Homebrew&rsquo;s gcc compiler,
  which has never been a problem in the past, but seems to be having some
  difficulty finding source files in OSX 10.10.  I don&rsquo;t know if the files got
  moved in the 10.10 update, but I do know it&rsquo;s causing me some headaches.</p>

<p>%p
  Running:</p>

<p>  {% codeblock lang:bash %}
  $> bundle update
  {% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>%p
  was giving me a build error:</p>

<p>  {% codeblock lang:bash %}
  Fetching gem metadata from <a href="https://rubygems.org/........">https://rubygems.org/........</a>
  Fetching additional metadata from <a href="https://rubygems.org/..">https://rubygems.org/..</a>
  Resolving dependencies&hellip;</p>

<p>  Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.</p>

<pre><code>  /Users/rringler/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p551/bin/ruby -r ./siteconf20141118-1331-708ezv.rb extconf.rb
</code></pre>

<p>  checking for dns_sd.h&hellip; no
  unable to find dnssd header
  <strong><em> extconf.rb failed </em></strong>
  Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of
  necessary libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more
  details.  You may need configuration options.</p>

<p>  {% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>%p
  Inspecting the mkmf.log, I see that ruby/rvm is trying to use the homebrew&rsquo;s
  gcc compiler (/usr/local/opt/apple-gcc42) to build the dnssd gem, and failing
  to find the dns_sd.h headers.  I have no idea why Homebrew&rsquo;s gcc can&rsquo;t find
  it, but I do seem to have a solution: reinstall Ruby 1.9.3 using Xcode&rsquo;s gcc
  compiler.</p>

<p>%p
  After uninstalling the existing Ruby 1.9.3</p>

<p>  {% codeblock lang:bash %}
  $> rvm uninstall ruby-1.9.3-p551
  {% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>%p
  I made sure I had the latest version of Xcode, and Xcode Command Line Tools
  installed.  I opened Xcode&rsquo;s preferences, and verified that it listed &ldquo;Xcode
  6.1 (6A1052d)&rdquo; in the Command Line Tools section (under the Locations tab.)
  Finally, I reinstalled ruby instructing RVM to use Xcode&rsquo;s clang-based gcc
  compiler:</p>

<p>  {% codeblock lang:bash %}
  $> rvm install 1.9.3 &ndash;with-gcc=clang
  {% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>%p
  and everything seems to work again; the dnssd gem now builds correctly.</p>

<p>%p
  Apparently earlier versions of Ruby 1.9.3 had issues with clang/llvm-based
  compilers, so this solution may not help if you&rsquo;re trying to
  install something earlier than ruby-1.9.3-p125, but if you just want the
  latest 1.9.3 (p551) and are having difficulty, give this a shot.</p>
