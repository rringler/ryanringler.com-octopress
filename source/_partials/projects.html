        <strong>Description: </strong> A small rails webserver that runs on a
        Raspberry Pi Model B that will monitor a plant's soil moisture and
        display the historical measurements. If the moisture level dips below a
        preset threshold, a rake task will trigger a small aquarium pump to
        water the plant
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why it's cool:</strong> I like this project because it's an
        interesting mix of hardware and software.  The Raspberry Pi is fully
        capable of supporting Debian linux and running a rails server, while
        this project relies upon an analog moisture sensor, an ten-bit A2D
        converter, and a power relay to switch on the aquarium pump.

        <strong>Description: </strong> A Ruby gem that creates a simple DSL for
        creating a Raspberry Pi web server to monitor sensors, switches, and
        buttons via the Pi's GPIO pins. Utilizes a simple, mobile-ready
        interface, and supports dns-sd/Bonjour discovery of other whipped-cream
        Pis on the local network.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why it's cool:</strong> Anything on the Pi is fun, but this
        project was also my first significant open-source contribution.  It was
        also my first foray into ruby gems, and let me learn a bit about Travis
        CI and dns-sd.

        <strong>Description: </strong> Your typical public-facing rails
        prototype that implements real-time public voting (similar to real-time
        polling during political speeches.) Uses bootstrap for layout, devise
        for user authentication, and Highcharts for data plotting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why it's cool:</strong> This project was pretty simple, but fun
        because I got to experiment a bit with the JSON API for returning
        real-time votes, and the JavaScript for continually submitting votes.

        <strong>Description: </strong> A small weekend project to learn a bit
        about Sinatra/Padrino.  This site scrapes the recreation.gov website for
        open dates in Yosemite's Lower Pines campground.  Utilizes the Padrino
        framework, ActiveRecord for data persistance, and bootstrap for
        appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why it's cool:</strong> This project was fun because it
        introduced me to an alternate MVC framework, and helped me realize what
        parts of rails really shine and what parts I could live without. It's
        also super convenient.
